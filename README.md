William Sonoma Coding Challenge

Framework: This example is made using ReactJs framework. It is default React project with standart structure, where I use class and functional components.

JSON with Data: I tried to load the JSON file several ways, because of CORS, it was not successfully, I added the JSON file(fakedata.js) with one main object, which is a copy of the data from https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json

Tests: I used Jest and Enzyme for unit tests, most of JavaScript files have a unit test script.
Run npm test and check if any errors come up.

Running the Server and Visiting the Site
Open a command prompt and run npm start to launch the server, if not provided it will run on port 3000.

Thanks & Regards
